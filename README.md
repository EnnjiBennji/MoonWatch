# MoonWatch

<img src="/Moonwatch.png" alt="Moonwatch"/>

The Moonwatch is a project originating from the Klipper community that tries to realize something similar to the project "Printer Monitor" by Qrome.
It utilizes the moonraker API in order to gather information about your printer's current status and displays them in a comprehensive manner. 
Whenever your printer is not running it simply shows a watch. 

The goal of the project is to make for an easy and cheap yet very useful and fun little project for all the Klipper lovers out there!

It has to be noted that this project is still in development and therefore everything is subject to change.

*** 

How to setup your watch see the [getting started guide](/docs/GettingStarted.md).

**Note:** Be aware this is an very early software state and there is no guarantee its working without any issues.

# Enjoy!
